🧠 Words Memory Game
The Words Memory Game is an engaging and interactive web-based application designed to challenge and enhance users' memory skills. Players are presented with a series of words to memorize within a limited time frame. Once the words disappear, users must recall and input as many words as they can remember.

This project was developed with a focus on clean code, modern design, and an intuitive user experience.
